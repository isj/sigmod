COMMENT SUMMARY FOR THIS FILE:

This implements two histogram (character frequency) based filters. The histogram of a
word is an array that gives the number of times each possible letter in the alphabet
occurs inside a certain word. For the word "food", the array would be

a b c d e f g h ... o ... z
0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 ... 2 ... 0

We define the delta d between two such histogram arrays as the sum of all absolute
differences of the counts of each pair of characters. Shortened example, see deltaSlow()
for the algorithm:

vec a 0 0 1 3 2 1
vec b 0 1 0 3 2 0
delta 0+1+1+0+0+1

The filter can be used for exact matches, hamming distance and edit distance although
it is only beneficial for edit distnace as matching exact words and hamming distance if
comparatively cheap anyway. For two words to be within edit distance t, their frequency
delta must be <= 2*t. This can be improved by looking at the possible edit operations. If
the length of the two words differs, that can only be caused by insert or delete operations.
These operations change the delta by 1, not 2 like substitution. Therefore, the criterion can
be improved to <= 2*t-lengthdiff where lengthdiff is the absolute length difference
between the two words.

While not overly costly, the naive way of executing the filter does not yield a sufficient
result. We therefore use SSE instructions to impove the filter by about a factor of 3. Also,
we have a shortened version of the filter which combines some characters. Its pruning
capability is not as good as the full version of the filter but it can be executed on one
sse register instead of two.
