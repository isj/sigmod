COMMENT SUMMARY FOR THIS FILE:

Processor is an abtract class which provides an interface for specific
processing strategies. It is used so that multiple ways of handling incoming
API calls can be implemented easily. For instance, a processor implementation
could be based on a queue of tasks, another could be single threaded and yet
another could collect statistics of the underlying benchmark.
